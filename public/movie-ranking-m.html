<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>

<hr >

<h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
<p>
I really love the clash between Spider-Man's and Peter Parker.<br >
Being Spider-Man destroys his life, he doesn't want to be a hero anymore, but he knows that he can't turn his back on the world.<br >
He must sacrifice everything he holds dear for the sake of everyone else.
</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>
I saw this movie as a teen, so it really changed my view on the world.<br >
Even nowadays, watching this movie makes me want to rebel against the system and be set free lol.<br >
The action scenes are phenomenal.
</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>
Great dialouge and lots of blood, what's not to like?
